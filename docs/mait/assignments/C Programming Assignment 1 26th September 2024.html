        <h3>Student Notes</h3>
        Ok so basically, do this on blank A4 size sheets (only blank, do not use ruled pages or register pages
         or anything like that). The first page needs to have all the information about the assignment written 
         along with MAIT and stuff (like the one in the assignmenet) but make sure it is all handwritten. It needs to have
         "submitted by - student name" on the right side and "submitted to - teacher name" on the other side. The entire assignment
         needs to be handwritten btw. Do not keep it in plastic folders, just take the sheets and staple them after ur done with it.
